Instructor: Paul Trebilcox-Ruiz

Although a relatively new technology, Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) has already proven itself to be a versatile and useful communication median. While it can be used for connecting devices to each other wirelessly, it also enables devices to act as beacons and broadcast data. In this tutorial you will learn about the BluetoothLeAdvertiser, which will allow you to turn a supported phone into a Bluetooth LE beacon without the need for additional hardware. You will also learn how to scan for Bluetooth LE advertisement data so that you can react appropriately within your own applications.
